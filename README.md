# Rubyist Test

This test was split into two parts, one of which is only a gist, so I'm using this as an index to link to both.

## Part 1

The task in part one was to rewrite inject - first without, then with recursion.

The results of that experiment are located here: https://gist.github.com/NotTheUsual/8773400

## Part 2

The second task was to create a model of a takeaway restaurant that could show a menu, take an order and text confirmation to your number (at least until Twilio cancelled our accounts without notice...).

That solution lives here: https://github.com/NotTheUsual/Takeaway
